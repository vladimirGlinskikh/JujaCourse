Given a sequence of natural numbers, not exceeding 30000. Find the maximum element divisible by 4. The program receives the number of elements in the sequence and then the elements themselves as input. In the sequence, there is always an element divisible by 4. The number of elements does not exceed 1000. The program should print a single number: the maximum element of the sequence divisible by 4.
