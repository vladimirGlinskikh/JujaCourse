In a computer game, each gamer has an army of units.

Write a program that will classify the army of your enemies corresponding to the following rules:

<h5>Units:  Category<br/></h5>

less than 1: no army<br/>
from 1 to 4: few<br/>
from 5 to 9: several<br/>
from 10 to 19: pack<br/>
from 20 to 49: lots<br/>
from 50 to 99: horde<br/>
from 100 to 249: throng<br/>
from 250 to 499: swarm<br/>
from 500 to 999: zounds<br/>
1000 and more: legion

The program should read the number of units and output the corresponding category.

Sample Input 1:<br/>
5

Sample Output 1:<br/>
several

Sample Input 2:<br/>
303

Sample Output 2:<br/>
swarm
