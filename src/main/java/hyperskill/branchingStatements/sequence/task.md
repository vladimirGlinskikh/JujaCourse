Write a program that reads a sequence of integer numbers and outputs true if the sequence is ordered (in ascending or descending order), otherwise, false. Keep in mind, if a number has the same value as the following number, it does not break the order.

The sequence ends with 0. Do not consider this number as a part of the sequence. The sequence always has at least one number (excluding 0).

Sample Input 1:<br>
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Sample Output 1:<br>
true

Sample Input 2:<br>
1 2 3 3 9 0

Sample Output 2:<br>
true

Sample Input 3:<br>
1 2 5 5 2 3 0

Sample Output 3:<br>
false
